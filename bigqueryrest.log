If the US government (or any other government) were able to suppress the output of media that criticized it by its intelligence services such that ordinary people would not dare reporting what was happening in their communities, this indeed would be totalitarian. The trend, however, is mostly to ignore problematic areas in favor of ones that make one happy.  For instance, focusing on the bright side rather than the dark side of mass immigration with a few selected pieces of anecdotal evidence.  One can almost always spot this selective highlighting at the expense of the larger dataset by the departure from math and \"feel good\" (or, conversely, \"shock\") stories. Since in general people prefer to feel good about themselves, they are either drawn to news which invalidates other parties (other races, members of other political parties) or to fluffy Hollywood productions (there is immense feel good value in watching things blow up on screen, esp. when the other side is ascribed to be \"evil\").\u003cp\u003eThat said, I have no doubt that there are many who would wish to see the United States (or other places) become more totalitiarian than in fact they are. The free market system we are in has reduced virtually everything to economic motives, which are good about preserving certain information channels at the expense of others."

Happy to trip across this reply.\u003cp\u003eI will keep your suggestions in mind, though right now there is no money to hire a designer.  I did not start this site to make money and getting well has left me deeply in debt (though not getting well would likely have worse financial consequences and I at least have hope of cleaning up my financial mess now that I am healthy enough to work consistent overtime).\u003cp\u003eI think the stuff I do is very safe.  It is certainly safer than the path most people with my condition take.  But what I am running into is that a lot of them just don't have background info I have and therefore people sometimes make extremely dumb mistakes that can seriously damage their health.  So what seems \"obviously\" safe to me is not necessarily safe for someone who lacks general information about physiology, chemistry, or whatever and therefore doesn't know to avoid certain pitfalls.\u003cp\u003eI'm actually glad to hear the amount of info is overwhelming.  I always feel there is way too little info on the site.\u003cp\u003eAs for the people who criticize:  To me, the main issue is that I have been thrown off some lists and the moderators usually side with the people who are attacking me.  So if I don't deal in some fashion with my critics, I may be unable to reach those folks who are interested. Yes, when I really don't feel well (or people have been especially ugly to me), I whine and cry about how people are mean to me.  But that isn't really my main concern.  However, some folks have found the website on their own without first meeting me on an email list.  And those folks typically are far more interested in and open to the information.  So I have been rethinking my relationship to my audience, I guess.\u003cp\u003eThank you for the feedback!  It's something to go on."

In a nutshell, think of the scene in &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; where the white team captain gets into a shoving match with a black team member. Initially, the black team member is afraid to push back. That&#x27;s the kind of thing that could end badly in the racist environment in which they live.

He does finally shove back, they engage in a friendly shoving match, and that is the moment where the team becomes a team and race stops mattering.\u003cp\u003eThis can be done to a woman.

This is part of why (last time I checked such statistics), on average, women who defend themselves with lethal force (usually premeditated and with a weapon) against an abusive husband do more jail time than men who finally beat their wives to death (\"heat of the moment\", with their bare hands) after years of abusing them.\u003cp\u003eI think electromagnetic makes some good points.  That doesn't justify a woman slapping a man but a) it does put it in a different light and b) there are many forms of abuse, so just focusing on who got slapped hardly tells the whole picture. I will note that I read somewhere (probably many years ago) that when men were asked what they most feared from a woman, the consensus was \"being laughed at\".  When women were asked what they most feared from men, they listed \"being murdered\"."

When I discovered that addressing excess acidity was effective in helping me need less medication, I thought this was some major revelation.  It turns out it is rather well established in the CF community that CF leads to very extreme excess acidity.  Yet it goes largely untreated, in spite of acidosis being a known serious medical problem.  Additionally, the salt issue is so well established as an issue for CF that a sweat chloride test is the single most common initial test for CF, yet nothing is really done to address that issue.  Both seem very obvious for anyone in the know yet both go largely ignored in treatment modalities.\u003cp\u003eAs for victim card, I've really had the crap kicked out of me for trying to share info. I have no doubt that at this point that negatively impacts the way I come across when discussing the issue.  I don't have some magic wand for how to make that go away. I think the ugliest thing said to me publicly was that someone implied that my son was the product of an incestuous relationship.  Moderators routinely side with my attackers and act like I have some unreasonable expectation for thinking I should be able to participate in conversation on the same footing as other members where such attacks would not be tolerated.  I have left lists over such incidents.\u003cp\u003eResearchers and doctors have expressed no interest in what I am doing.  My doctor's response to my dramatic improvements in health was to schedule me fewer and fewer appointments and express zero curiosity as to how I was doing so much better.  For the most part, people on CF lists are also not really interested.  Their primary response is to be very defensive and default to accusations that I am a charlatan and a snake oil salesman. I find this personally very difficult to comprehend or deal with.  I have CF.  Why on earth would make any of this up?  People are suffering and dying and begging for a cure.  One would think that my testimony about my experiences would be warmly welcomed rather than viciously attacked.  I am both baffled and hurt by this consistent response over the past five years.\u003cp\u003eI didn't get myself well in order to impress anyone.  I am willing to help if I am able, but I am not interested in martyring myself. I got well to get my life back, not to find new ways to be tormented by life.  If getting my life back is all it accomplishes, that is enough in my book.  (I have heard similar stories of health improvement due to diet/lifestyle changes about other people. I am apparently not the only one who made significant changes to diet and lifestyle and saw major improvements.  Most people apparently just go on living quietly rather than fight with other people about it, an approach I continue to work on in spite of my big mouth.) The degree to which the CF community plays the victim card and expects other people to pay for their survival and very high on-going medical expenses is something that looks to me like a big part of the problem, both in terms of mental models and logistically.\u003cp\u003eAs for the \"excess mucus\" theory, I do not buy it.  I have seen more than one public discussion about women with CF suffering vaginal dryness, in some cases so severe it ruined their sex life. I see no reason why one set of mucus membranes in the body would work the opposite of the rest for a genetic disorder that impacts all cells in the same manner. One study I ran across indicated that it was not excess mucus clogging up the lungs of people with CF, it was phlegm -- ie infection -- and that, in fact, people with CF produce too little mucus, not too much.  This fits with my experience that when my sinuses are too dry, that's when I have more lung issues and sinus issues.  I have seen women with CF complain of \"goopiness\" (vaginally).  I see no reason to believe that isn't also a form of drainage from infection, similar to phlegm build up in the lungs.  It seems to me if it were mucus, then women with CF shouldn't have any of the difficulties with sex which they report.\u003cp\u003eI am not claiming that lack of reports of egregious problems is proof positive that it works, much less that it would work equally well for all people with CF. I am claiming that people who have tried some of my suggestions and also reported back have indicated surprisingly good results, often in quite a short period of time (for example, one parent whose teenaged child was supposed to be listed for lung transplant put them on supplements I suggested and in a very short period of time -- something like two weeks -- saw such dramatic improvement in lung function that listing for transplant stopped being a consideration).  I am also indicating that while people in the CF community are very critical, often in a very ugly fashion, none of the criticism I have received so far has come from someone who tried my ideas and got sick from it.  It seems to come from people who reject all of it out of hand as \"too good to be true\" without further investigation.\u003cp\u003ePeace."

Warts and fever blisters are both caused by virii and cause growths, similar to tumors.  I can't think of any parasites, bacteria, or fungi which causes similar growths  -- and I've tried. (Anyone who knows of something else which causes tumor-like growths, please speak up.  This question is of serious interest to me.  Cancer runs rampant in my family.)  Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection which causes growths on the skin similar to skin tags.  The cause of skin tags is \"unknown\" (yet it seems logical to me it is some other virus) but they are described as \"benign tumors\".\u003cp\u003eAlthough conventional medicine seems to find viral infections extremely hard to combat, alternative treatment circles I hang out in find viral infections very easily treated and offer a number of different options for doing so.  I believe that I and my sons have been killing off whatever virus or virii we carry which eventually could/would turn into a diagnosis of cancer.  I get die-off rashes that include skin tags and brown and red spots of the sort which look like pre-cancerous lesions.  My oldest son has a very keen sense of smell and has been around several family members who had cancer.  He says he can smell it when we have cancer die-off.  Given my experiences with him, I believe him.\u003cp\u003eI generally don't talk about this in public.  My personal problem is that people tend to either call me \"arrogant and egomaniacal\" or \"a liar, charlatan, and snake-oil salesman\".  \"Arrogant and egomaniacal\" is probably the better thing to be accused of as it suggests people think it \u003ci\u003ecan\u003c/i\u003e be done, just not by little ole me.  \"Liar, charlatan, and snake-oil salesman\" suggests people think it can't be done at all, by anyone, regardless of the resources at their disposal, much less by little ole me and my limited resources.  I don't believe any technology will solve my personal issue of being accused of such things.  It's an issue of \"the hundredth monkey\" or \"mindshare\" or \"groupthink\"....something along those lines -- ie:  No one else is able to do it, so you can't possibly be telling the truth.

I am in desperate need of money, getting myself and my sons well when the world says it cannot be done has all come out of my pocket and my pockets aren't deep. I'm deeply in debt and cash flow in recent months has been very ugly.  What I am doing is both cheaper and more effective than conventional medicine and some people are benefiting from the information on my website(s) but it isn't paying me anything.  It feels incredibly unfair because if I were going the conventional medicine route, the costs would be a great deal higher but much of it would be covered by state aid, federal aid, insurance, etc.  So I would get all kinds of \"support\" and money thrown at my problems for staying sick and getting sicker and sicker until I qualified for disability. But get myself well?  On your own b*tch.  I have estimated that medical care for people in the US with my condition runs around $3 billion/year. An article I saw recently would put it at roughly $1.5 billion/year.  I think that's low, but it's still a lot.  There is a recession on.  I think I have something of value to offer.  But how do you monetize something of value?  Maybe this guy is helping folks pay the bills so they can keep offering something of value.  Is that such a bad thing?  I have often considered yanking my websites because they make no money.  People seem to find value in them yet I'm not making anything.  I resent that.  Why should I benefit others and cut my throat to do so?"

Like it's hard?\" (channeling Elle Woods).  Showing them the path I took and why I think it worked is more likely to be instructive and helpful and inspiring.\u003cp\u003eIn the original discussion, someone indicated that most divorces are done without lawyers.  To me, this is actually encouraging information.  I know there are do-it-yourself divorce books that address the legal side of it.  I really don't think the lack of a lawyer is what blows people's minds.  I think the \"genuinely amicable\" part is what blows people's minds.\u003cp\u003eMost people I talk to who are divorced have ugly nicknames for the ex and are clearly still quite bitter and carrying substantial baggage.  I have had a number of experiences where women have tried to dump on me on the assumption that I would agree with their deeply hostile view of men.  It is an extremely inaccurate assumption.  So I think if there is anything instructive about my experience, it is that putting down your baggage can be done and that life generally goes smoother if you do that.  This is not the type of information that goes over well as \"advice\" because the people who most need it are in a mental and emotional space where suggesting they let it go is generally received as judgmental, unsupportive, not understanding and so on.  But a good story they can identify with and a good cry might help whereas a lecture tends to just make their bitterness and baggage all the more intractable."

There are plans to redo the main page, there really are.  But I really don't want to put the focus on me (re your comment about explaining \"who I am\").  I have struggled a lot with the fact that information on the site is so personal -- not because I care about sharing such info (I spent years in therapy for sexual abuse endured as a child and both my therapists were ministers -- I'm perfectly comfortable blathering on about crap that makes other people desperately want to tape my mouth shut) but because of the negative fall-out that occurs and that it takes the spotlight off the information per se, which is where I want it to be.  So I wrestle a lot with that and I very much want to work on making the site more about \"this is good info and helped me\" and less about \"me, me, me\", which just causes all kinds of problems in all kinds of ways.\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI'd consider coming up with a short timeline - as a new visitor, I might be interested in quickly knowing things like how far along you are in your journey.

I would much rather be in the entertainment space.  But you can't separate this dramatic piece of my life experience from who I am and I don't think it's possible for me to entirely walk away from it.  I think if I shut down the site and made a fortune doing something else entirely, then years down the road reporters would hound me for info on how I got well. I would rather just leave the site up and say \"here's that info -- now back on topic, it's so not that interesting, thanks\".  As I noted elsewhere, the site grew out of an off-the-cuff remark I made on an email list I belonged to and the strong reactions people had to the information I casually commented on as a normal part of my everyday existence (a list, btw, that had nothing to do with health issues at all)."

It might not be a paradigm that would occur to you because your situation is different from that. But I think we need to not turn our noses up at giving people the chance to make what looks to you like a poor wage.\u003cp\u003eA quick google suggests Nevada&#x27;s minimum wage is either $7.25&#x2F;hour or $8.25&#x2F;hour, depending upon what benefits they have. If you are only making $7.25&#x2F;hour, then $10&#x2F;hour is more than a 33% increase in income. That extra $2-$3&#x2F;hour may seem piddling to you, but for people who have very little, it can be huge and make a big difference in their quality of life. Furthermore, if it also gets them access to a car that they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise have, this may be hugely life changing. Living without a car in America can be quite challenging."

But I guess you mean how secure you are with a recent version of Wordpress. I think this is though question, because Wordpress relies to a high degree on external components and plugins. There is probably no single pure Wordpress Blog, because the original Wordpress archive already relies heavily on external dependencies. That&#x27;s where many of the issues were found as correctly pointed out by wyck. However this reliance on external code, without a Wordpress team or at least a software that is evaluating the code-quality or any other metric, you can&#x27;t be secure. Yeah we can argue with: \u003ci\u003e&quot;But Wordpress is n-times more popular than X.&quot;\u003c/i\u003e However it still makes WP very vulnerable to attacks. I&#x27;ve cleaned and recovered some hacked commercial wp blogs and shops myself (not installed by me, but the previous dev).  So whatever you believe in WP may be, just get over it.

Additional complications arise when you want to pluralize phrases, since different languages pluralize phrases differently, etc. It&#x27;s a pain to setup an effective localization workflow using the traditional approach.\u003cp\u003eLocalize.js handles all of this automatically, and removes the need to convert your template files or manage your own phrases and translations.

As with a lot of security, it's a usability trade-off.\u003cp\u003eWe work hard to make sure that people only ever access Stripe over HTTPS. Most people use the Stripe API through an existing library. Since the API doesn't work over HTTP, any such library is guaranteed to use HTTPS. Stripe itself is on Chrome's built-in HSTS list, sets HSTS headers, etc.\u003cp\u003eThe scenario Stevie describes is unlikely to be an issue unless the user is implementing his or her own library. In that case, though, they're almost certainly going to be using test API credentials. Stripe's API will never return a successful response when you access it over HTTP, so you'll figure out that you can't do this on the very first request.\u003cp\u003eMore broadly, what exactly is being defended against isn't particularly clear. There are much easier ways for someone implementing their own library to screw up (skipping cert verification is extremely common and leaves you perpetually vulnerable to HTTPS MITM), and there are many other plausible vectors for an attacker.\u003cp\u003eEven if we \u003ci\u003edid\u003c/i\u003e change this, we'd only have solved one small class of accidental key leaks. You could accidentally specify \"stripe.com\" instead of \"api.stripe.com\", for example, and stripe.com will of course always accept HTTP. Or you could typo the domain and send your key to someone else entirely.\u003cp\u003eIf we ever did want to solve this, we'd probably do something like:\u003cp\u003e- Monitor HTTP Authorization headers sent to api.stripe.com.\u003cp\u003e- Notify the user if they ever accidentally send a secret key in the clear.\u003cp\u003e- In addition to notifying the user, we could potentially roll the key automatically (though this runs the risk of breaking production code).\u003cp\u003eBut I don't think disabling HTTP helps much. (I do think it'd be good if we started monitoring the frequency with which this happens -- if it's common, we should certainly do something like the above; if it ~never happens, it presumably doesn't matter.)\u003cp\u003eSeparately, I think that the HMAC-based signature scheme that Stevie proposes is something we might want to do at some stage. A very early version of Stripe actually had something very similar. The issue with all protocols in this vein is that they involve considerably more complexity on the user's end and are harder to debug. But they definitely have some nice security properties."

The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.\u003cp\u003eLarge corporations tend to decrease economic inequality. You can't measure individual productivity well within large organizations, and even if you could, it would strain the fabric of the organization to reward people that way.  They also hide a lot of inequality by giving elite employees benefits that don't show up in their salaries (\u003ca href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://paulgraham.com/ladder.html\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cp\u003eWhat happened at the end of the 1970s was that the most ambitious people started to lose interest in working their way up the corporate ladder.  They wanted to get paid upfront.  That was why the term \"yuppie\" was born then.  Before 1980 it was rare to find young professionals with lots of money.  In the old days, they were all still paying their dues at that age.\u003cp\u003eI remember the transition quite clearly.  When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation.  It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.  By 1980 we were starting to see a glimpse of the world we now live in, where the ambitious people are all free agents."

I still don't understand how a train ride away the same lifestyle would cost 50USD a day. Why?\u003cp\u003eA lot of the numbers people use to describe how people live are misleading. In poorer countries, organizational structures are flatter.  You pay the owner of the chicken for the eggs.  This leaves out the money for the factory workers, the truckers, the marketing, the grocery store (and all its hierarchies), and profits for the shareholders who perform no labor at all.  This is monetary waste.  This waste increases prices for the consumer.\u003cp\u003eThis is true in a lot of countries outside the u.s. The food in the restaurant is cooked by the owner of the restaurant, not a wage earner.  The efficiencies found by automation and commoditization of labor are lost in the waste of trickle down economics.\u003cp\u003eAnother aspect of life in poorer areas of the world - including many areas of the united states - is the barter that occurs between many individuals.  I'll mow your lawn if you paint my house.  I have the mower, you have the ladder and the brushes.\u003cp\u003eThis type of cooperation is lost in an individualistic society like the united states where everyone performs a role.  The cashier, the delivery person, the accountant.  In \"poorer\" societies, these roles are performed by a single person in many cases.\u003cp\u003eThis division of labor has, rather than increased productivity and decreased cost, in fact increased cost due to monetary waste at each exchange.  Listen to Noam Chomsky describe the \"real Adam Smith\" and how he believes the division of labor will destroy the individual through wage slavery.  \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugq86q9KyPE\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugq86q9KyPE\u003c/a\u003e  I have not read \"wealth of nations\" myself, to verify Chomsky's opinion of Smith's work, but I have it on hold at the library and will soon.\u003cp\u003eThink of it like physics.  Just as energy is lost when it changes form, money is lost when it changes hands.  The more hands through which that money passes between the producer and the consumer, the more money is lost to waste."

I also used the PDF version when I was somewhere with a computer and wanted to read, but didn't have the paper copy with me.\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the time I would read the paper copy. I also print out longer articles to read - paper seems less fatiguing to read from than a screen.\u003cp\u003eThe font, font size, column width, and line spacing seem to make a big difference with how tiring it is to read on the screen. The Free Culture PDF was one of the the easiest documents I've come across to read. The default WordPress and Blogger themes use similar column widths and line spacings - this suggests that there might be an optimum way to display text for readability.\u003cp\u003eThis is a bit of a leap, but if you're designing a site that has a lot of paragraph-form text, mimicking the typography of a typical paperback will probably do a lot for your site's readability.

     "v": "regarding use of advanced techniques my experience is mostly limited to lectures i attended (several on model checking, automated theorem proving, analysis and verification, and one on verification of compilers). i figure the field is somewhat scattered into the following categories:\u003cp\u003e* model checking (error-detection/bug-discovery by using temporal logic formulas)\u003cp\u003e* interactive theorem proving (e.g. the coq-based work on verification of compilers of xavier leroy at inria, various isabelle based research projects, e.g. tum.de, cam.ac.uk, and twelf/nuprl at cmu/cornell), by formalizing   denotational/operational semantics\u003cp\u003e* program correctness, axiomatic semantics (hoare triples)\u003cp\u003eusing model checkers is usually a good idea if you can specify correctness properties in temporal logic formulas. i once wrote a simple and small quantification-based dsl where programmers could provide boolean predicates and set-generating functions and domain-experts would encode domain/system properties that were automatically checked or even triggered follow-up actions. i once attended a lecture given by gerard berry of esterel technologies (they do a lot of verification for airbus) and AFAIR according to him there will actually be dedicated \"verification engineers\" specifying formulas that ensure system correctness.\nusing systems that support counter-example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR, helmut veith et al.) one can iteratively develop from imprecise abstractions.\u003cp\u003eiterative theorem proving is where i think the most important work is going on, albeit (in my perception) in an orthogonal different way. in a complex system, like a compiler for a non-toy language, correctness is one of the most important problems (e.g., in the embedded systems market, automotive industry, etc.). the german research fund is doing a lot of things here, previously verifix, now a research project named verisoft. the french are very active, too. i am not sure about the situation in north america, though. in the course on verification of compilers, our lecturer told us that many companies in mechanical engineering were not really concerned with performance but rather about compilation being erroneous (one could check the bug-databases of the common compilers for reassurance on that one) i think there will be a lot of job opportunities in the future in this market, where by means of formalizing domain knowledge/programming languages one could ensure system correctness. currently, the security related industries are champions here, but with the emerging proliferation of computing technology i can imagine a world where people are fed up with badly written software, which will force engineering to verify at least certain properties.\u003cp\u003eand last but not least, while i think that axiomatic semantics are important, i think it is almost always too time consuming to write hoare triples. i have \"the science of programming\" by david gries, which should help my incompetent brain to speed up here, but the truth is: it's non-trivial for many programs. this is why i feel that many things are going the \"interactive theorem proving\"-way.\u003cp\u003ethis sums it up pretty much for me. please note that i am not an expert on these issues--though very interested. axiomatic semantics and interactive theorem proving as mentioned above are not mutually exclusive, i.e., i think that one should very well be able to ensure correctness via hoare triples proven in interactive theorem provers."

Also in this case, the overhead of of generic call will grow linearly with the number of methods, right?\u003cp\u003eIn Python, you could limit generic dispatch to argument type only without losing generality since you could override the `isinstance` operator.  For instance, you could define a `const()` type so that `isinstance(x, const(100))` is true if and only if `x == 100`.  Then your example could be written in Python as:\u003cp\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e  foo = generic()\n\n  foo.when(const(0))\n  def foo_0(x): print \"passed in zero\"\n  foo.when(const(100))\n  def foo_100(x): print \"passed in 100\"\n  foo.when(const(200))\n  def foo_200(x): print \"passed in 200\"\n  foo.when(int)\n  def foo_default(x): print \"passed in\", x\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\nThis is not as elegant as in a language with native support for generic functions, but it works.

Additionally Weimar Germany was on brink of civil war in the end.\u003cp\u003eHitler then did introduce the Reichsarbeitsdienst, essentially forced but payed labor for the unemployed. And he did ramp up spending, first mostly for infrastructure later shifting to the military.

With these policies he managed to get more than 5% real GDP growth each year, [3] together with steeply falling unemployment. [4] ( Wikipedia has an article with more details.

For example, if I pass you a higher order mathematical function that calculates the first derivative of another function (f), you can create an algorithm that integrates the function \u003ci\u003esymbolically\u003c/i\u003e, thus obtaining (another) primitive (related to the original f by a constant).\u003cp\u003eNote that I mean to symbolically calculate derivatives and integrals, \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e numerically. A homoiconic language can deconstruct any object representing code and can construct another object based on the underlying structure of the original, \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e based on any particular \u003ci\u003evalue\u003c/i\u003e of the original.

You don&#x27;t have to have a textual representation of the function. A.i. you don&#x27;t parse your own source code.\u003cp\u003eLISP was actually invented to be able to implement functionals and symbolic calculations like this. The original paper demoed implementing function differentiation (among other things)."

When it was published, EPR showed that action by contact (the separation principle) and the _completeness_  of QM can't both be valid. At least, this was Einstein's intention with EPR - in letters to Schrodinger he expresses his chagrin with the way Podolsky, who wrote the paper, buried Einstein's main point in technicalities.\u003cp\u003eNow, when you say he derived conclusions he didn't believe were true, that's kind of wrong, since all he derived was a dilemma (completeness or separation, not both (but possibly neither)). He took this to show that if we maintain the separation principle, then QM needs to be viewed as a statistical account of objects with properties it can't describe (but he never took that to mean hidden variable theories like Bohm's were the answer).\u003cp\u003eSo, my point is, he believed in the correctness of QM (just not in the completeness). He believed in QM being true - just not that is was the whole truth. He believed in the correctness of the EPR derivation and in the correctness of the dilemma at the end. When you say he used a theory he didn't believe was correct, I think that's wrong - he just didn't believe it was the finished article. And when you say he derived conclusions he didn't believe were true, I think that's wrong too, since he derived a dilemma that he very much believed in. In the end he chose the wrong side, but that's not relevant here.\u003cp\u003eYou say Einstein believed this was a reductio ad absurdum - but that's flat out wrong I think. EPR relates to the completeness of the formalism (if the separation principle is taken to be true), not the correctness."

They still interact with their neighbors' matter, they pass through intergalactic particles all the time, and they're simply not isolated enough to do this undetected. At a larger scale, the universe is not cluster-like, it's filament-like:\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://cosmicweb.uchicago.edu/filaments.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://cosmicweb.uchicago.edu/filaments.html\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose filaments are all gravitationally connected and they share the same type of matter from which they were created.\u003cp\u003e&#62; Isn't the void separating clusters really really empty?\u003cp\u003eNo, vacuum is relative. While the matter density of intergalactic space is very low, the sheer size of that space means there is a lot of stuff in it. The intergalactic space is mostly filled with protons that would be detectably annihilated if they came in contact with an antimatter galaxy. Furthermore, galaxies are colliding and spewing jets of stuff at each other all the time. There would always be annihilation going on that we could see.\u003cp\u003e&#62; And what if roughly half of the galaxy clusters are made of matter and half of antimatter? Would the annihilation radiation be detectable from the background?\u003cp\u003eYes, in two ways. First, if there were antimatter pockets as \"small\" as galaxy clusters within our observable universe, we would detect massive annihilation patterns along their boundaries from a time when the universe was much more dense than it is now. This is not the case, as the CMB is uniformly chaotic and mirrors the likely structure of the observable universe in its infancy. There are no such pocket boundaries visible in the cosmic background radiation.\u003cp\u003eSecond, there would still be annihilation going on, both from anti-galaxies plowing through the intergalactic proton plasma and from galactic collisions. This would mean seeing antimatter galaxies really lighting up in the gamma spectrum and we'd also see some very long-lasting otherwise unexplained intense gamma sources in the sky. Both are not occurring within our visible horizon.\u003cp\u003eThere is also the distinct possibility that antimatter pockets would, due to billions of years of annihilation events, be separated from matter pockets by huge gaps. We do not see such gaps in the distribution of matter.\u003cp\u003eAgain, all this may be going on beyond our horizon, but if it does that also means antimatter regions would have to be \u003ci\u003evastly\u003c/i\u003e bigger than galaxy clusters."

I like to have stimulating discussions with smart, like-minded people who offer new perspectives. And while I'm at it, I like startups, too. While I have no personal connection to YC, I like hearing from their companies first hand because they are interesting. I think it's great that people doing startups (YC or not) sometimes post their demo online here on HN. I also love to hear from hackers who did nifty one-offs on the weekend. And open source projects. And in-depth discussions about programming. And hacker culture. The whole thing.\u003cp\u003eI am also clearly not one of the Old Crew. You have been a fan of the band since before they became cool and I have not. I get it. But for all that talk about evaporative cooling, let's not forget that every community \u003ci\u003eneeds\u003c/i\u003e fresh blood to survive. More often than not, I feel I'm in the right place here.

A first step would likely involve stopping to make it and its users look bad. What you are doing is simply sabotage from the inside and it's exacerbated by the fact that you are one of the most influential users around here. By making it appear desolate, you participate actively in dragging it down. We can agree on the need for continued improvement without suggesting that everyone but the Old Crew are idiots.\u003cp\u003eThere is something else in your comment that just rubs me the wrong way. It reminds me of that time-honored trick where someone first totally demolishes the worth of a person or company, only to portray themselves as seeing the hidden \"potential\" seconds later and then magnanimously suggest how they're going to rescue said person/company. I apologize if this is unjustified, but it is the impression I got from your post.\u003cp\u003eBy the way, I believe one of the easiest ways to improve something \u003ci\u003eright now\u003c/i\u003e is by committing yourself to vote down snappy low quality one-liner comments that add nothing to the discussion."

You can forget about normal Germans ever using an English website, it has to be at least translated if not re-branded. German people by and large do not watch English TV or movies, they expect everything to be translated and somewhat culturally re-branded. Combine that with existing separatist and isolationist movements, which by the way have always played a part in the inofficial German mindset, I can see this exceedingly stupid idea seriously gaining ground.\u003cp\u003eOn a meta level, I think you&#x27;re overusing the word agenda here to create a polemic atmosphere where none was warranted. Agenda implies that someone wants to bring across a piece of propaganda, disregarding the facts if necessary. What \u003ci\u003elignuist\u003c/i\u003e is doing is called having an opinion. You may disagree with it, but that does not make it an agenda."

Since you define the data API yourself, you can tailor it tightly to only the exact operations you need. This makes it more difficult to flat-out drain everything (or even query everything, depending on your app). It&#x27;s also another layer of insulation. The fact that it&#x27;s another, non-standard access protocol also helps. If I&#x27;m an attacker, I&#x27;ll probably have a harder time figuring out how the custom data layer works; and when I&#x27;m done with that I still need to actually siphon the data, which will ideally require me to either issue millions of suspicious requests, or try to break into the API server itself, which has a drastically reduced attack surface compared to a typical web app. Which is where your second question comes in:\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e&gt; And why is it easier to monitor for unusual activity?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause you know what the legitimate access patterns of your app look like, you can raise flags programmatically. In fact, you can incorporate certain checks right from the time you start writing your API.

Water ionizes really conveniently so you can make it an acid OR a base (which is sorta unusual and it can talk to acidic or basic things), and is polar (its got a + and a - electrical side, more or less, so it can talk to + or - things), and has hydrogen bonds (so you get liquid lifestyle at gas temps)\u003cp\u003eFor one why, look up amphoteric and zwitterion.  Water has a super convenient pH range where about a ten millionth of pure water self ionizes aka ten to neg seventh or pH of 7, and all kinds of super convenient reactions occur above and below that pH and its really easy to manipulate ionization rates around that level without using too much.  You don&#x27;t need just a liquid but one where you can really screw around with something like amino acids by easily and cheaply changing the ionization rate of the liquid.  So there are super convenient chemical reactions that depend on the ionization level of the liquid and its really easy to manipulate water.  Conveniently water &quot;just works&quot; without having to add tons of other stuff to it.\u003cp\u003eLiquid methane isn&#x27;t polar enough to really be useful when messing with ionic substances (table salt, etc).  Whatever you use for a liquid, it needs to be polar so ionic stuff like salts can dissolve.  It turns out that interesting chemistry doesn&#x27;t happen with non-polar substances at normal temps; thats why when you bury stuff for a couple million years the only thing left behind undecayed (more or less) is non-polar hydrocarbons (crude oil).  Ammonia is polar but has other issues.\u003cp\u003eThe hydrogen bonds are important.  Water should be a gas at room temp.  Really, it should, looking at bonds and molecular weight and stuff.  Yet the hydrogen bonds that form keep it liquid at room temp.  So you get &quot;gas speed&quot; chemical reactions at &quot;high&quot; room temperature, yet its liquid to a ridiculously high temp.\u003cp\u003eMaybe some custom liquid silicone with some bolted on weirdness could make a useful artificial blood plasma or &quot;stuff&quot; for life to live in.

Because one is hyper random access and the other is massively sequential, also typical block size for one is probably measured in K and the other typical transaction size is probably measured in G.  And there&#x27;s certain latency consideration.  And probably others.\u003cp\u003eThe real question is if costco is successful, why are b-schools charging $100K to churn out cookie cutters that don&#x27;t cut it in the real world?\u003cp\u003eIf costco were swirling down the drain, AND simultaneously rejected &quot;MBA culture&quot; (or HN culture, or 4chan culture, doesn&#x27;t really matter) then it wouldn&#x27;t be much of a story.  The question is why MBA schools, despite all the worship of their holy paper credential, can&#x27;t graduate people who apparently know anything about retail, or at least don&#x27;t know how to be legendarily successful in retail.\u003cp\u003eIt would be like a med school that charged $100K but simply decided to not teach their students anything about biochem and then no one seemed to care.  &quot;Eh, blood sugar and electrolyte levels, eh, that stuffs hard, lets skip it and do some extra anatomy studies&quot;.  Or in engineering, &quot;Well, I never really liked finite element analysis and you&#x27;ll probably not be expected to successfully do it on the job, so here&#x27;s a engineering degree anyway and best of luck to ya&quot;.  And no one cares other than a successful, yet fringe industrial company, who doesn&#x27;t hire eng school grads to do finite element analysis."

The Shah backed by western powers oppressed the people and the current regime backed by other powers oppresses the people (not to mention what happened to moderate Iranians at the time of the revolution).

PHP has also been around for 13 years, while Rails was first released to the public just three years ago. Both have been gaining popularity since their introduction, which suggests an explanation for the greater number of large scale PHP sites having nothing to do with the suitability of the tools: PHP has been around longer and has more users. If you want to measure like that, you should be programming in Java, not PHP.\u003cp\u003eThe number of projects attempted and failed with a given toolset is a much better indication of its suitability than overall popularity.

The fact that the prison system in the US does not reform but punishes instead and convert first time convicts into hardened criminals? Other factors?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cp\u003eProbably not the guns. Germany has about a third the rate of gun ownership the US does and its rates of serious violent crimes, both with and without guns are much less than a third those of the US. All of Scandinavia, Switzerland and Iceland have high rates of gun ownership and even lower crime rates.\u003cp\u003eThe prisons might have an impact, but I think at least as important is the post-release re-integration in to society. The parole system in the US is set up more to ensure that released prisoners can be easily subjected to further punishment if need be than to help them lead productive lives.\u003cp\u003eAn important factor is that those countries have a distinct culture and sense of community. People are more willing to hurt others they don&#x27;t see as part of a group to which they are loyal. I actually see the lack of cultural homogeneity as a strength for the US overall, but I think it tends to lead to more crime.\u003cp\u003eAnother important factor is the relative lack of poverty in northwestern Europe. Someone who sees none of their prospective ways to earn a living legally leading to a comfortable lifestyle is more likely to consider illegal and antisocial approaches."

The site just recently was made available -- it's clearly not 100% complete. HN has submissions of half-complete (or &#60;=MVP) stuff all the time. This, and the fact that there is no business model present, the fact that the lessons stop at a very abrupt point, and the fact that the authors here are so eager for feedback, I believe renders the harshness of your harsher arguments unhelpful.\u003cp\u003e3. How you suggest one would teach someone programming from scratch I think would work for very few people (though if done well, I have no doubt it would work for some). I think a majority of people you would try that strategy on, how I am perceiving it anyway, would lead to burn out and people end up hating programming before much time was up. In fact, I believe that approach is one taken so often in school, and look where it has brought us... a majority of people hate math, hate [insert random science subject], and hate [insert nearly any academic field sometimes even including the one they majored in]. How is it that we fail so horribly as to often cause such strong aversions to certain subjects, or rather what we believe are the subjects. I don't believe anyone truly hates math (or any academic subject), they just have a horribly skewed idea of what it is."

Often it's a result of a better intellectually stimulating environment when growing up. Students of the same age that grew up in less stimulating environments will naturally be behind in a number of areas due to having less developed (or less extensive) neural structures in the areas of background knowledge, mental models, and other various mental procedures. In a lot of cases I believe these students can catch up, but placing them in even less stimulating environments will not accomplish this, and rather widen the gap.\u003cp\u003eSecondly and in addition, a major part of this study is about the effects various influences have on an individuals' intelligence theories and motivation -- effects of expectations, stereotypes, and also teacher behavior in class. Plenty of studies have shown how various external influences have a massive effect on a students' achievement due to the theory on intelligence they form from these influences.\u003cp\u003eSo I agree giving good teachers to everybody is the solution, however there are definitely other environmental factors involved that complicate the issue. For one, breaking up students into gifted/non-gifted categories adds yet another stereotype that could potentially be harmful to both the non-gifted and gifted students.\u003cp\u003eI believe the solution would encompass having teachers that understand how these influences affect students, which will give them the capability to structure their classes and their instruction in such a way to dissipate any damage these influences can make, and instead turn them into catalysts for growth."

Tribes is an interesting example of a \"hack\" that completely re-invents the game (in most people's opinions, for the better).\u003cp\u003eFor those not familiar, a bit of gaming history:\nTribes is a FPS where the players have jetpacks and can fly around in the air. The jetpacks have limited energy, so players ended up having to spend a lot of time on the ground too. One particularly innovative aspects of Tribes was it's expansive maps.  It was like a Battlefield game, but 5 years earlier. By only running and jetting, it could take minutes to get across a map, which is important considering the primary objective of the game was to move the opposing team's flag from side of the map to your team's side.\u003cp\u003eThe hack was: players discovered that jumping at the instant the player lands on downhill surface caused them to accelerate in the downhill direction.  Mashing repeatedly on the jump key going down a large hill would cause the player to accelerate all the way down the hill, as if there was no friction with the ground (hence \"skiing\").  Someone wrote a script that automated this act so all a player had to do was hold down the jump button instead of pressing it repeatedly.\u003cp\u003eThis bug completely re-invented the game into something no one imagined it would be. Many players embraced it, I am sure some did not. It added a layer of complexity and made the game addictively fast paced (with skill you could now get across a map in seconds).  The competitive community embraced the new style of play and the developers had no choice but to not patch the bug.  This bug arguably became the defining gameplay aspect of Tribes.\u003cp\u003eThe lesson? As mentioned here many times, the users are what make your product special. Sometimes they will invent uses for it you never imagined :)"

Huge numbers of initial settlers will die. The task of carving out a life in a barren lifeless radiation-soaked desert will demand the same level of fanatical, all-encompassing zeal. It will be, in short, a \u003ci\u003ecrusade\u003c/i\u003e, only the adversary will be the environment rather than another group of people. It would even have an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; character. I can imagine the settlers&#x27; picturing a future blue Mars -- the eschatological promised land -- and resolving that it will be this, or death.\u003cp\u003eWe create because we are not content. Our perpetual discontent is the source of pretty much everything admirable about us. But when we can&#x27;t create? When no positive avenue is available?\u003cp\u003ePicture yourself as an ambitious visionary personality in a failed client state like Iraq. What realistically can you do? Labor for your puppet state? Pay protection money to gangsters? You hear tales of torture, then learn some of them are true. If a drone pilot screws up and kills your family, it will be written off as an acceptable loss... assuming it&#x27;s acknowledged at all. The message you receive from the world is clear. You have no value. Your death is acceptable. You are worthless.\u003cp\u003eWe are not domesticated animals. People are not content to be worthless. You cannot humiliate and grind down human beings without consequence. If no other avenues are available they won&#x27;t go quietly. They will go mad.\u003cp\u003eIf I were uneducated, had no opportunity, and lived in a hellhole like post-war Iraq, I could easily see being drawn to an apocalyptic death cult. To die to bring about the end times would be far more appealing than the alternatives.\u003cp\u003eI totally get it. I mean, go look up America&#x27;s interrogation programs and &quot;rectal feeding.&quot; What the hell did we expect to happen?\u003cp\u003eAt this point I don&#x27;t even know what we can do about it. This same thing happened in post-WWI Germany after the post-war reparations and punitive treaties wrecked the German economy and helped Hitler rise to power. After WWII we got a clue and implemented the Marshal Plan and the result was a peaceful sane Europe that has endured to this day, but we apparently un-learned that historical lesson... either that or we don&#x27;t think it applies to people who aren&#x27;t white."

There are times when a huge overtime crunch is needed or when something is &quot;on fire&quot; and has to be dealt with right now, but the data is showing that overwork, lack of sleep, and too much focus on only one thing results in a loss of higher-order mental capacities such as creativity and long-term thinking.\u003cp\u003eI&#x27;ve experienced this subjectively myself... doing the workaholic thing for more than month or two and literally being unable to remember what it was that I was really doing or why I was doing it. You basically degenerate into some kind of crank-out-the-next-thing automaton with no big picture thinking ability or vision.\u003cp\u003eI&#x27;ve also seen second hand what occurs when this happens to a company&#x27;s leadership, and I think a lot of avoidable failure spirals originate this way. If you&#x27;re not being successful you need to pivot, and that takes creativity and an ability to stand outside the box of what you&#x27;re currently doing. Those mental abilities are the first to go in an overwork scenario.\u003cp\u003eOther negatives include depression, anxiety, and impulsive behavior. It was actually kind of scary. I had to give up the tech entrepreneur orbit for a while until I could re-center myself, and coming back to it now I consider it very important to avoid that trap.\u003cp\u003ePersonally I think the cult of workaholism is more about machismo than real performance. There&#x27;s this weird ego thing in a number of industries including tech where people brag about how many hours they work, how little they sleep, etc. It&#x27;s stupid."

This is endlessly reinforced in school. You get right answers and wrong answers on tests, but that's because school tests are toy problems not real problems. In reality there are better answers and worse answers and worse-is-better answers and ugly-hack-to-ship answers.\u003cp\u003eBut think about the Church-Turing thesis a bit, and universal computation, and it becomes obvious that there are infinitely many ways of solving any arbitrary problem.

Evolution works by discovering \u003ci\u003eone\u003c/i\u003e answer and then following pathways through the fitness landscape to converge on better and better answers. Sometimes it actually does discover global optimums, or sometimes it just settles on something that works well enough given all the trade-offs. (In some problem spaces there is no clear global optimum.)\u003cp\u003eBut I see something more here. His opinions on gender are just batty. There is evidence for gender dimorphism in humans, but he takes that evidence and does a Forrest Gump run with it all the way off the field and into the bleachers.

So the first strike is that it grossly generalizes programming behavior -- people program for different reasons in different organizations using different styles. If the author were trying to make some point about all of them, he failed.\u003cp\u003eAnd considering the audience here at Hacker News, the style he's describing is not even the most appropriate -- perhaps it fits on proggit where I'd guess there are more enterprise and/or beginning programmers, but not here with so many startuppers and research students. Obviously it's not his fault this article is posted here, but my point is that it's especially annoying to find such top X lists on Hacker News.\u003cp\u003eIn case anyone's curious, here's a quick point-by-point rebuttal that explains my view of programming:\u003cp\u003e10. Small, functional (no-side-effects) functions with explanatory names are far superior to leaving comments that explain the how \u003ci\u003eor\u003c/i\u003e the why. I would take that small chunk, make it a function called newtonRaphson() and be done with it.\u003cp\u003e9. Fair enough.\u003cp\u003e8. I'm a researcher and startupper so feature creep is the norm, not the exception -- I don't know what the next step will be until I do the current one and see whether it works (research) or gains traction (startup).\u003cp\u003e7. My research advisors/co-founders are the closest I have to managers, and they defer to my judgment about programming matters. That means that we plan schedules, etc., keeping a realistic view of how long things will take to program. We work with each other, not against each other as enterprise bosses frequently seem to do. (Also, the xkcd cartoon linked has almost no relevance to his point.)\u003cp\u003e6. I used to believe this, until I realized that writing documentation made my programs better. This is especially true when documenting UIs -- if it's too complicated to explain easily in the docs, it's too complicated to use.\u003cp\u003e5. Agreed.\u003cp\u003e4. Again, this is something I used to believe before, but am now finding useful to actually learn about the hardware to some degree. Not only does it let me fix (and sometimes prevent) problems, it's good to have an idea of what's going on in the actual system so you have a better idea of what to upgrade when the time comes. Scalability is a lot about hardware.\u003cp\u003e3. Agreed, although I bet he doesn't consider the converse: when programmers try to explain things to laymen using jargon. And in many senses, the 'user is always right.' In particular, nature can't be fooled (research), and if I'm doing something that lots of users are complaining about, it's my fault, not theirs (startup).\u003cp\u003e2. If this list is supposed to apply to all (or even some large subset) of programmers, and this claim is about all other programmers, then it follows that he himself is not pleasant to work with. Undoubtedly there are many people it is not fun to work with, but I've worked with many people over the years who have been fantastic partners. We had disagreements, people wrote shitty code and made mistakes, sure, but we still got on well enough to work together. And of course, I'm constantly evaluating myself, making sure I'm not the one being an ass, etc. (which perhaps the author's article doesn't consider).\u003cp\u003e1. I find programming to be an iterative process -- if I'm not adding more functionality step-by-step, I'm doing something wrong. Working code at every stage is so important for morale and momentum. I also find it impossible to plan for everything up front and I inevitable end up rewriting portions of code to better fit the features I need. I don't mind this at all, and in fact see it as a necessary step in writing good programs. So while sometimes I do wince at seeing some old code of mine, more frequently I find it a good starting point for adding some new feature or even working on some completely unrelated problem.\u003cp\u003eFinally, if the author is actually annoyed that (a) he's going to be ridiculed because (b) he can never reach perfection and (c) \"it's simply not possible to write perfect code because the standards upon which our code is judged is evolving every day\", he's a completely different species of programmer (and perhaps human) from me. The unreachable goal of perfection is one of the greatest thrills for me -- if I could truly become perfect at some task, I'd be rather disappointed. I'm also not going to be ridiculed because of bad code, in large part because I'm the harshest critic of my own code. And finally, while it may not be possible to write perfect code, it has nothing to do with the fact that the judgment standards are changing -- code is either good or not, and I always strive to make it better than it currently is.\u003cp\u003eAnyways, I've spent way too much time now rebutting this article."

It&#x27;s important to have high quality samples considering manipulating the sound (especially time-stretching) can easily alter its quality.\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, it&#x27;s still hard to obtain music in Flac format. Few online music stores offer tracks in that format. [1] It&#x27;s maybe a marketing issue. Everybody knows what an Mp3 is. It also took me some time to learn that such a format as Flac existed. But it&#x27;s also a size issue. Although the compressing algorithm is incredible, people prefer to download (legally or illegally) a 80 MB album rather than a 500 MB one, regardless of its quality, because they either won&#x27;t hear the difference or just don&#x27;t care. And considering iTunes doesn&#x27;t support Flac (only their own Alac format that is even less known), Flac isn&#x27;t meant to be widely adopted yet.\u003cp\u003e[1] \u003ca href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_online_music_stores\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comparison_of_online_music_stor...\u003c/a\u003e"

(though I'd personally hit up Craigslist for an old Thinkpad).

I also do my own engine work and maintenance. I feel \u003ci\u003egood\u003c/i\u003e about keeping another car out of the landfill. The $$ cost, though, is a fraction of what I pay. Other costs include\u003cp\u003e1) Occasional valve adjustment, points/timing adjustment, etc\u003cp\u003e2) Driving in a constant state of awareness wrt the machine that   I'm operating; I listen to the engine, transmission, wheel hubs,   and monitor my gauges more than any typical driver I know.\u003cp\u003e3) My car is slow. My trips take longer. I have to drop to second   gear on steep hills.\u003cp\u003e4) I sometime have real mechanical issues. I've repaired a fuel   injector on a road trip. On another, I ran on 3 cylinders until  I found a garage and then helped the mechanic work on it, scavenging   parts from an old Beetle behind the garage.\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI\u003c/i\u003e happen to be pretty happy with my automobile situation, but would I recommend Joe Commuter do it to save $$ on the up-front purchase of an automobile? Never. I think it'd be insulting. It's overwhelming for the problem, and therefore doesn't \u003ci\u003ereally\u003c/i\u003e advance anything. It doesn't help Joe Commuter. Like when people discuss the cost of food and you suggest \"Here's $40 worth of seeds. With this you've got vegetables for a year -- get to work.\"\u003cp\u003eThat said, again, I think we're appreciating the same things."

GeoIP databases are typically populated by user activity, e.g., mobile devices phoning home to get wifi-based location, credit card txns, etc. None of this traffic comes from a ptp interface address on a core router. GeoIP databases tend to have a resolution of about a &#x2F;24, whereas infrastructure netblocks tend to be chopped up into &#x2F;30s or &#x2F;31s for ptp links and &#x2F;32s for loopbacks, so two adjacent &#x2F;32s could physically be located in wildly different parts of the world. More than likely, that IP address was previously assigned to a customer. The more accurate source of information would be the router&#x27;s hostname, which clearly indicates that it is in London. The handoff between Virgin and Cogent almost certainly happens at Telehouse in the Docklands.\u003cp\u003eIf someone were, in fact, trying to intercept your traffic, they could almost certainly do so without you noticing (at least at layer 3.)"

Moving beyond conventional drugs that interact biochemically with the body, it will have built a big “bioelectronics” business that treats disease through electrical signalling in the brain and elsewhere.\u003cp\u003eNeurological problems, from stroke and epilepsy to depression, will be treated through electronic implants into the brain rather than pills or injections. Even diabetes and obesity will be attacked in ways that seem like science fiction today, by sending electrical signals to malfunctioning cells.\u003cp\u003eThat remarkable vision comes from one of the world’s most powerful pharmaceutical executives, Moncef Slaoui, head of research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug company.\u003cp\u003e“At present every pharmaceutical and biotech company makes chemical or biological molecules that target [biochemical] structures such as proteins in the body,” said Mr Slaoui. “No one is designing medicines to interact with the electrical signals that are the other language of biology.”\u003cp\u003eWith enthusiastic support from Sir Andrew Witty, his chief executive, and other senior colleagues, Mr Slaoui wants GSK to become the first large company to make bioelectronics a central plank of its long-term planning.\u003cp\u003e“The sciences that underpin bioelectronics are proceeding at an amazing pace at academic centres around the world but it is all happening in separate places,” he says. “The challenge is to integrate the work – in brain-computer interfaces, materials science, nanotechnology, micro-power generation – to provide therapeutic benefit.”\u003cp\u003e...\u003cp\u003eToday, only a minuscule fraction of the electrical activity in people’s brains can be read by computer. Even so, recent experiments have given spectacular results.\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most remarkable was a recent US clinical trial in which tetraplegic patients used their thoughts to direct robotic arms. The research team, led by John Donoghue and Leigh Hochberg at Brown University, released a video of a 58-year-old patient called Cathy, whose mental activity drove a robot to pick up her drinking bottle from a nearby table and move it up to her mouth so that she could sip some coffee. A heartwarming smile illuminated Cathy’s face after she had drunk without help from a human carer for the first time in 15 years.\u003cp\u003eThe BrainGate system developed by the Brown University team has a sensor, about the size of a small aspirin pill, with 100 hair-thin electrodes implanted into the top of the patient’s motor cortex, the brain area that controls movement. It is connected to an external computer, which translates the neural activity into commands to drive a robot.\u003cp\u003eAccording to another paralysed patient called Bob, hard thinking is not required: “I just imagined moving my own arm and the [robotic] arm moved where I wanted it to go.”\u003cp\u003e...\u003cp\u003eSome of the best bioengineers in the US, including John Rogers of the University of Illinois, Brian Litt of the University of Pennsylvania and Jonathan Viventi of New York University, are developing a new generation of soft computer interfaces, made with flexible silicon circuitry that can bend and stretch to match the curves of the brain.\u003cp\u003e...\u003cp\u003eAlthough bioelectronics research currently focuses on the brain, its potential extends much wider. “Electrical signalling is not confined to the central nervous system,” says Mr Slaoui. “We could make use of signalling in the peripheral nervous system too.”\u003cp\u003e...\u003cp\u003e“The beauty of electrical signalling is that it has only a local effect,” says Mr Slaoui. In contrast, even a well- targeted drug drenches the whole body in unwanted chemical.\"\u003cp\u003e(small percentage of article excerpted under statutory fair use, 17 USC 107.)"

I tried to explain FDIC insurance and how some banks offer ATM reimbursements and free checking. The mother was probably never exposed to banking services and may be suspicious of things like free checking. Just the fact that the mother was primarily concerned about safety is telling. I remember my father taking me to open up my first checking account at a young age. Some people never get that.\u003cp\u003eI also remember reading a profile some time ago about pay-day lenders (can&#x27;t find the link but I think I saw it on HN). The profile actually brought up how the employees working at the pay-day lenders often times have a very personal relationship with customers. It makes sense since a lot of the same people are going back weekly. The terms are often very misleading if you&#x27;re unfamiliar with concepts like APR and the market price for these types of services.\u003cp\u003eI am always interested when I see the ATM receipts left from those sketchy ATMs. More often that not, I see a $2-3 fee for a $20-$40 withdraw. I imagine people the people paying these fees think of it like a fixed fee and don&#x27;t put it in context of percentage. Same holds true for pay-day lenders.\u003cp\u003eInteresting article about someone who, although economically disadvantaged, is able to be financially savvy.\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/10/15/130595403/living-at-the-poverty-line\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;money&#x2F;2010&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;130595403&#x2F;living-a...\u003c/a\u003e"

(Defining art broadly; captioned movie clips are included.)  In the past few years, some creative people started making really good gifs that took advantage of these features.  Then the trend spread through web culture.  The next generation made gifs because &quot;making gifs is what clever artistic people do on the internet&quot;.\u003cp\u003eIt&#x27;s always been easy to create a looped animation format that combines the feature list above with a better compression scheme.  Now that gifs are so popular, someone recognized the need and made one.\u003cp\u003eIMO, the 256-color dithering was more of a necessary evil for most gif creators, although some took advantage of it.  It looks nostalgic on 90s Gourard-shaded untextured computer graphics.  But for movie clips, etc, I think many will be glad to get rid of it.  I bet we&#x27;ll see a sect of gif creators who think mp4s are not authentic while most people won&#x27;t care.\u003cp\u003eYour last comment reminds me of Alvin Lucier&#x27;s &quot;I Am Sitting In A Room&quot; (wiki&#x2F;youtube).

It wouldn't require specialised can hardware and could drive most of the benefit (only emptying when required).   You could double the size if more capacity was required.\u003cp\u003eAlso, I would expect that these would fall into a very predictable pattern, with some cans requiring emptying 5 times a week, some 8 times a week, some twice a week.  It seems some simple modelling would also give you many benefits for a very small upfront-cost.\u003cp\u003eI have visited many friends places that had compactors installed when their kitchens were new, and over time they just stop bothering with the compaction and use it as a regular disposal.  Usually because the compaction is messy, faulty or just too much bother to use.  I would expect public trash cans to have the same problems, but magnified.\u003cp\u003eThe whole thing looks like a solution searching for a problem - bludgeoning a simple problem with too much technology."

This is the core reason people (including myself) place no credence whatsoever in climate modelling.  I'm happy to change my mind when someone can prove they know all or enough of the inputs to make the model highly accurate.  What would be the effect of another 10 hurricanes per year?  What about a reversal or diversion of the Gulf stream?  How about a permanent el nina in the Pacific?  None of these are black swans and yet they would all negate current climactic predictions."

This is, IME, more rewarding to a limited attention span audience than starting from scratch.\u003cp\u003e4) Come up with a simple coding project than can be modularized.  Assign 1 student or group different subroutine tasks and then pull it all together into a larger program that runs each subroutine.  Simple ideas are things like a conversion app utility, expense tracker, etc."
